# Rails 6 Simple Pundit Authorization Application

This project is a demonstration of a Rails 6 application with Devise for authentication and Pundit for authorization.  In addition, a simple implementation of Bootstrap being installed into Webpack using Yarn.

## Getting Started

These instructions will allow you to make a copy of the project yourself, and get it up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

RubyMine 2019.3, Ruby 2.6.6, and Rails 6.0.2.2 were used to initially make this project on a machine with PostgreSql installed locally.  The application was created as minimalistically as possible.  SQLite should work as well as any other database 

### Creating

Create the rails project on your system.  If you are trying PostgreSql for the first time you may need to execute in the terminal:

```
rails db:create
```

followed by:

```
rails db:migrate
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
